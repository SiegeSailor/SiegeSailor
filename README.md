# Cover Letter

I am a full-stack developer with experience cooperating with 100+ engineers and developing software independently. In my years of professional work, despite intensely focusing on front-end development, I also spent a lot of time on back-end knowledge and DevOps â€” Everything is worth learning as long as it is related to software engineering for me. Regardless of my enthusiasm, I fully understand the responsibility of a developer/engineer, which is to overcome obstacles by offering efficient solutions.
